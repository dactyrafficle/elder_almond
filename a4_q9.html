  <p> the treatment effects can shift the intercept, or influence the slope. so to that extent we should have some idea of the way treatment are outcome are related </p> 
  
  <p> the better we understand the functional form, the more points far away from the cutoff are useful </p>
  <p> without a strong idea behind the form of the assignment variable, points far away from the cutoff have more opportunity to realize their real functional form, resulting in outcomes we may incorrectly attribute to treatment or not treatment </p>
