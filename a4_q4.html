  <h4> A4 Q4 : WHEN TO USE INDIVIDUAL FE ? </h4>
  
  <p> i can't think of a spec test for this. but i might do the following : </p>
  
  <ul>
   <li><p> do we have more than 1 observation for each entity / individual ? then we <i>could</i> use entity / individual FE </p>
   <li><p> i would just use something like anova. each entity / individual is a category. and with the y being continuous, we could decompose var(y) to that within the groups and between groups via LIE </p>
   <li><p> if the variance between groups is large, i would think FE is probably a decent starting point </p>
  </ul>
