  <h4> A4 Q5 : THE BLOCK BOOTSTRAP </h4>
  
  <p> some of the simpler forms of bootstrapping have a sample X, and draw resamplse from X at the individual level </p>
  <p> but the block bootstrap is more appropriate when there are many little groups within X, where the errors in each group might be correlated<p>
  <p> or if we have time series data where the errors might be correlated, we could break up the data (which might not have any natural blocks or clusters), into our own clusters / blocks of consecutive observations. </p>
  <p> i haven't seen anything to rule out partially overlapping blocks </p>
  
  <p> in the case of block bootstrapping, instead of resampling from X, we resample the blocks / clusters of X </p>
  <p> if you don't have enough clusters, that's not much different than having a small sample size </p>
